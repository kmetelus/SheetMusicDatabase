Sasha and Kevin ---

ACK!  What database engine are you using?

Good descriptions of dat types, but I was looking more for the specific kind
of information a user might want.  For example, "What songs did Kid 'N Play
write from 1992 through 1998?" or "How many songs did Flea play bass on for
the Red Hot Chili Peppers?"  or even "How many songs from 2002 had the same
composer and artist?"

The ERD looks great!  You two did a wonderful job on this document.

Total: 9.5% out of 10% which is an A.
